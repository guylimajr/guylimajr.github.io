            <p>Microsoft OneNote is a notetaking application that supports a bunch of different ways to take notes.</p>
            <p>We were completely overhauling our Windows 8 app for Windows 10 and needed a new way to present all of OneNote's commands.</p>
            <p>With a colleague, I designed a new command interface that:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Conveyed what made OneNote special</li>
              <li>Scaled to accommodate the commands being added for the Windows 10</li>
              <li>Was easily learnable</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This design shipped as part of the Windows 10 release in the Fall of 2015.</p>

      <section id='design_goals'>
        <h2 class='column columns_12'>Design Goals</h2>
        <p class='section-description'>When I joined my colleague on this project, we defined three main goals for a new commands interface.</p>
        <section>
          <div class='column columns_4'>
            <h3>Show You What OneNote is Good For</h3>
            <p>When you start OneNote for the first time, it's hard to tell how it's different from other apps you already know and use, like Word.</p>
            <p>The UI should showcase what makes OneNote special.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='column columns_4'>
            <h3>Scale to Fit Lots of Commands</h3>
            <p>OneNote for Windows 10 was adding more features quickly as it moved to reach feature parity with OneNote 2013.</p>
            <p>We needed a UI model that would be able to accommodate many commands and could accommodate more as they were added.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='column columns_4'>
            <h3>Easily Learnable</h3>
            <p>The Radial Menu, the previous command UI, posed usability issues for users. Many never figured out how to fully use it.</p>
            <p>We wanted new users to focus on exploring what the app was good for, not worrying about how to use it.</p>
          </div>
        </section>

      <section id='background'>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p class='section-description'>My colleague had been working on this project for a little while before I joined. She was trying to solve problems some problems specific to the previous Windows 8 app in addition to some that had existed across all OneNote clients for years.</p>

        <section>

          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <h3>OneNote Keeps Many Kinds of Things</h3>
            <p>Microsoft OneNote is a notetaking application that lets you keep many different kinds of content, like</p>
            <ul>
              <li>to do lists</li>
              <li>scanned documents/whiteboards</li>
              <li>audio recordings</li>
              <li>file attachments</li>
              <li>handwriting</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Avid OneNoters love that they're able to easily store whatever they want in OneNote.</p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section>
          <img src='images/commands/Word_vs_OneNote.png' alt='' class='column columns_6'>
          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <h3>At First, It Looks A Lot Like Word</h3>
            <p>For years, user studies and interviews told us that people didn't really get what made OneNote different from Word. Starting OneNote for the first time, they'd notice:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A Ribbon filled with a lot of text editing commands, just like Word</li>
              <li>A big white page where they can type, whereas Excel and PowerPoint have distinct canvases</li>
            </ul>
            <p>They would just walk away from the app unsure of how it was any different than Word, which they already knew and used.</p>
            <p>We wanted to clarify that OneNote was a great place to store todos, images, audio recordings, and files that you want to remember later.</p>
          </div>

        <section>
          <img src='images/commands/Radial_Menu.png' alt='' class='column columns_6'>
          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <h3>Need To Replace The Radial Menu</h3>
            <p>OneNote for Windows 8 put its commands in a Radial Menu, which had two main problems:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Usability: many users never figured out that tapping the arrow in the outer sector of the Radial Menu would show more commands</li>
              <li>Scalability: as OneNote grew, we were having issues adding commands; the Radial Menu could only house 8 per-level</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We wanted to replace the Radial Menu with something that was easier to use and could accomodate the new features we were adding for the Windows 10 release.</p>
          </div>

          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <h3>Designing New Interactions Isn't Working</h3>
            <p>My colleague believed that elevating a few, key features to the top-level of the UI would help users' understand OneNote's unique value.</p>
            <p>She had so far mostly attempted to do this by changing how you interact with the Ribbon, like making it hidden by default or adding an extra row of buttons.</p>
            <p>However, things just weren't clicking in usability studies.</p>

      <section id='color-coding'>
        <h2>Redesigning Information Architecture</h2>
        <p class='section-description'>My colleague's previous efforts had focused on changing how you interacted with the Ribbon. When I joined the project, I explored if we could simply redesign its information architecture to better show OneNote's value.</p>

        <section>
          <img src='images/commands/All_The_Ribbons.png' alt='' class='column columns_6'>
          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <h3>People Have Learned The Ribbon</h3>
            <p>The Ribbon is a UI pattern that had been used throughout Office and Windows for over 7 years. Usability studies showed users were comfortable and capable using the standard Ribbon in OneNote apps due to their years of experience using it in elsewhere. Changing how the Ribbon worked lead to usability issues as users had to learn something new.</p>
            <p>Other Office apps showed that the Ribbon scaled to a huge number of commands.</p>
            <p>If we could just use the Ribbon pattern as-is, we'd have solved usability and scalability. I proposed we clarify OneNote's value by changing where things went in the Ribbon.</p>
          </div>
        </section>

          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <h3>Showing What Makes OneNote Special</h3>
            <p>My belief was that there were two main problems with how the OneNote's Ribbon was structured:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The tab that was shown by default was filled with text formatting commands, which aren't the most relevant to OneNote</li>
              <li>That tab was called home and ordered first, which made it feel like the place you're meant to be.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To address this, I</p>
            <ul>
              <li>introduced a new tab called Notes, filled with notetaking commands, and made it the first tab</li>
              <li>renamed the "Home" tab to "Formatting and deprioritized its order</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section>
          <img src='images/commands/Prototype.png' alt='' class='column columns_6'>
          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <h3>Does It Work?</h3>
            <p>After sharing my work with my colleague, she created a low-fi prototype using PowerPoint and we ran a user test. We found:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Good: Users were able to identify what made OneNote unique from the commands presented at the top-level</li>
              <li>Bad: Users expected to be able to do their formatting from the Home tab, like they did in other apps</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </section>

      <section id='remodel'>

        <h2>"Home" Remodel</h2>
        <p class='section-description'>Users had problems with formatting commands not being in the first tab, like they are in other Office apps. I set out to redesign the Home Tab to provide access to formatting commands, but emphasize the commands that made OneNote unique.</p>

          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <h3>Prioritizing Commands Based On Data</h3>
            <p>I used a heatmap, created from analytics, to determine which commands were most-used in OneNote. This helped me ensure the right commands would be available at the top-level.</p>
          </div>

          <img src='images/commands/Final_Sketches.png' alt='' class='column columns_6'>
          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <h3>Merging Notes and Formatting</h3>
            <p>I sketched different information architectures that placed the top-used formatting commands and the uniquely notetaking commands at the top-level of the Home tab.</p>
            <p>I placed the less-used formatting commands in popovers, at the second-level.</p>
          </div>

          <img src='images/commands/iOS_Open_And_Closed.png' alt='' class='column columns_6'>
          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <h3>Making Sure It All Fits</h3>
            <p>My colleague and I created redlines for how the UI would respond to different screen sizes.</p>
            <p>Since the design would help users' understanding of OneNote regardless of platforms, I created redlines for iOS. She handled Windows 10.</p>

        <h2>Results</h2>

        <section>
          <img src='images/commands/UWP.png' alt='' class='column columns_6'>
          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <p>This design shipped as part of OneNote's Windows 10 app in late 2015. Relying on the existing Ribbon paradigm let users use their existing knowledge and made it easy to introduce new commands as they were available.</p>
            <p>User feedback showed that some users found the Radial Menu more delightful. However, usability studies showed that an overwhelming majority were more competent at using the updated Ribbon.</p>
            <p>User tests showed that this new model greatly increased user recognition of what OneNote's main selling points were.</p>
