            <p>Microsoft OneNote is a notetaking application that supports a bunch of different ways to take notes.</p>
            <p>We were completely overhauling our Windows 8 app for Windows 10 and needed a new way to present all of OneNote's commands.</p>
            <p>With a colleague, I designed a new command interface that:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Conveyed what made OneNote special</li>
              <li>Scaled to accommodate the commands being added for the Windows 10</li>
              <li>Was easily learnable</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I simplified the design task by shifting its focus from interaction design to information architecture.</p>
            <p>This design shipped as part of the Windows 10 release in the Fall of 2015.</p>

      <section id='design_goals'>
        <h2 class='column columns_12'>Design Goals</h2>
        <p class='section-description'>When I joined my colleague on this project, we defined three main goals for a new commands interface.</p>
        <section>
          <div class='column columns_4'>
            <h3>Show You What OneNote is Good For</h3>
            <p>When you start OneNote for the first time, <strong>it's hard to tell how it's different from other apps</strong> you already know and use, like Word.</p>
            <p><strong>The UI should show that OneNote helps you keep different types of notes</strong>.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='column columns_4'>
            <h3>Scale to Fit Lots of Commands</h3>
            <p><strong>OneNote for Windows 10 was adding more features quickly</strong> as it moved to reach feature parity with OneNote 2013.</p>
            <p>We needed a UI model that would be able to accommodate the many commands that existed and would soon be added.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='column columns_4'>
            <h3>Easily Learnable</h3>
            <p>The Windows 8 app used the Radial Menu for its commands. Usability studies showed <strong>many users struggled with the previous UI</strong>. Many never figured out how to fully use it.</p>
            <p>We wanted new users to focus on exploring what the app was good for, not worrying about how to use it.</p>
          </div>
        </section>
      </section>


      <section id='background'>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p class='section-description'>My colleague had been working on this project for a little while before I joined. She was trying to solve problems specific to the previous Windows 8 app in addition to some that had existed across all OneNote clients for years.</p>

        <section>

          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <h3>Users Love That OneNote Keeps Many Kinds of Things</h3>
            <p>Microsoft OneNote is a notetaking application that <strong>lets you keep many different kinds of content</strong>, like</p>
            <ul>
              <li>to do lists</li>
              <li>scanned documents/whiteboards</li>
              <li>audio recordings</li>
              <li>file attachments</li>
              <li>handwriting</li>
            </ul>
            <p>OneNote's most <strong>avid users love that they can store whatever they want</strong> in OneNote.</p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section>
          <img src='images/commands/Word_vs_OneNote.png' alt='' class='column columns_6'>
          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <h3>But On First Use, It Looks A Lot Like Word</h3>
            <p>For years, user studies and interviews told us that <strong>people didn't really get what made OneNote different from Word</strong>. Starting OneNote for the first time, they'd notice:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A Ribbon filled with <strong>a lot of text editing commands</strong>, just like Word</li>
              <li><strong>A big white page where they can type</strong>, whereas Excel and PowerPoint have distinct canvases</li>
            </ul>
            <p>They would just walk away from the app unsure of how it was any different than Word, which they already knew and used.</p>
            <p>We wanted to <strong>clarify that OneNote was a great place to store todos, images, audio recordings, and files</strong> that you want to remember later.</p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section>
          <img src='images/commands/Radial_Menu.png' alt='' class='column columns_6'>
          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <h3>Need To Replace The Radial Menu</h3>
            <p>OneNote for Windows 8 put its commands in a Radial Menu, which had two main problems:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Usability</strong>: many users never figured out that tapping the arrow in the outer sector of the Radial Menu would show more commands</li>
              <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: as OneNote grew, we were having issues adding commands; the Radial Menu could only house 8 per-level</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We wanted to replace the Radial Menu with something that was easier to use and could accommodate the new features we were adding for the Windows 10 release.</p>
          </div>
        </section>

          <img src='images/commands/Previous_Work.png' alt='' class='column columns_6'>
          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <h3>Designing New Interactions Isn't Working</h3>
            <p>My colleague believed that elevating a few, key features to the top-level of the UI would help users' understand OneNote's unique value.</p>
            <p><strong>She had tested changing how you interact with the Ribbon</strong>, like making it hidden by default or adding an extra row of buttons.</p>
            <p>However, <strong>things just weren't clicking</strong> in usability studies.</p>

      <section id='color-coding'>
        <h2>Focusing on Information Architecture</h2>
        <p class='section-description'>My colleague's previous efforts had focused on changing how you interacted with the Ribbon. When I joined the project, I explored if we could simply redesign its information architecture to better show OneNote's value.</p>

        <section>
          <img src='images/commands/All_The_Ribbons.png' alt='' class='column columns_6'>
          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <h3>People Have Learned The Ribbon</h3>
            <p>The Ribbon is a UI pattern that had been used throughout Office and Windows for over 7 years. Usability studies showed users were comfortable and capable using the standard Ribbon in OneNote apps due to their <strong>years of experience using it</strong> elsewhere. Changing how the Ribbon worked lead to usability issues as users had to learn something new.</p>
            <p>Other Office apps showed that <strong>the Ribbon scaled to a huge number of commands</strong>.</p>
            <p>As-is, <strong>the Ribbon solved solved usability and scalability</strong>. To simplify the design process, I proposed we <strong>clarify OneNote's value by changing the Ribbon's information architecture</strong>.</p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section>
          <img src='images/commands/Whats_Wrong.png' alt='' class='column columns_6'>
          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <h3>What's wrong with OneNote's Ribbon?</h3>
            <p>I formed the hypothesis that <strong>OneNote's Ribbon made the app feel like it was meant for creating polished documents</strong>, rather than for taking notes for yourself. I identified three main problems:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>The default tab was filled with text formatting commands</strong>, which make documents look good but aren't needed for notetaking</li>
              <li>That tab was <strong>called "Home", which made it feel like the place you're meant to spend much of your time</strong>.</li>
              <li>Unique notetaking commands like <strong>insert picture, attach file, and record audio, were hidden in the "Insert" tab</strong></li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section>
          <img src='images/commands/First_Sketch.png' alt='' class='column columns_6'>
          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <h3>Showing What Makes OneNote Special</h3>
            <p>I expiremented with different layouts that <strong>elevated OneNote's key features to the default view</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Created a new default tab called "Notes"</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Filled the "Notes" tab with notetaking-specific commands</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Renamed the "Home" tab to "Formatting</strong> and deprioritized its order</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section>
          <img src='images/commands/Prototype.png' alt='' class='column columns_6'>
          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <h3>Does It Work?</h3>
            <p>After sharing my work with my colleague, she created a <strong>low-fi prototype</strong> using PowerPoint and we ran user tests. We found:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Good: Users <strong>identified what made OneNote unique based on the commands</strong> presented at the top-level</li>
              <li>Bad: Users <strong>expected to be able to do formatting from the "Home" tab</strong>, like they did in other apps</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </section>

      </section>

      <section id='remodel'>

        <h2>"Home" Remodel</h2>
        <p class='section-description'>Users had problems with formatting commands not being in the first tab, like they are in other Office apps. I set out to redesign the Home Tab to provide access to formatting commands, but emphasize the commands that made OneNote unique.</p>

        <section>
          <img src='images/commands/Heatmap.png' alt='' class='column columns_6'>
          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <h3>Prioritizing Commands Based On Data</h3>
            <p>I <strong>used a heatmap, created from analytics, to determine which commands were most-used in OneNote</strong>. This helped me ensure the right commands would be available at the top-level.</p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section>
          <img src='images/commands/Final_Sketches.png' alt='' class='column columns_6'>
          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <h3>Merging Notes and Formatting</h3>
            <p>I sketched different information architectures that <strong>placed the top-used formatting commands and the uniquely notetaking commands at the top-level</strong> of the "Home" tab.</p>
            <p>I placed the <strong>less-used formatting commands in popovers</strong>, at the second-level.</p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section>
          <img src='images/commands/iOS_Open_And_Closed.png' alt='' class='column columns_6'>
          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <h3>Making Sure It All Fits</h3>
            <p>My colleague and I <strong>created pixel-perfect mockups</strong> for how the UI would respond to different screen sizes.</p>
            <p><strong>This design added value across all platforms</strong>, so I created mockups for iOS. She handled Windows 10.</p>

            <p>This design <strong>shipped as part of OneNote's Windows 10 app</strong> in late 2015. Relying on the existing Ribbon paradigm let users rely on their existing knowledge and made it <strong>easy to add new commands as they were built</strong>.</p>
            <p>User feedback showed that some users found the Radial Menu more delightful. However, <strong>usability studies showed that an overwhelming majority were more competent</strong> at using the updated Ribbon.</p>
            <p>User tests showed that this new model <strong>greatly increased user identification of OneNote's main selling points</strong>.</p>
