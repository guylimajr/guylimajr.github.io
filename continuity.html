              I lead the design of the award-winning puzzle game, Continuity.
            </p>
            <p>I iteratively prototyped gameplay and level design of the game to</p>
            <ol>
              <li>identify what made the game particularly fun</li>
              <li>expand upon that unique fun</li>
              <li>make onboarding part of the fun</li>
              <li>address player data and feedback post-release</li>
            </ol>
            <p>It was created as part of my master's program at Chalmers University of Technology. The game was made by Elias Holmlid, Dmitri Kurteanu, Stefan Mikaelsson, and me over two months.</p>
            <p>Continuity was released in November, 2009. It was awarded Best Student Game at the 2010 Independent Games Festival. It has been played by over 12 million players.</p>

          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <p>In Continuity, the world is broken into tiles. The player alternates between controlling the character and the tiles.</p>

            <p>When <strong>zoomed in</strong>, the player <strong>moves the character</strong>.
            <p>When <strong>zoomed out</strong>, the player <strong>slides the tiles</strong>.

            <p>Each level is a maze where the character must collect a key and reach the door.</p>

      <section id='finding'>
        <h2>Finding the Fun</h2>
        <p class='section-description'>I conceived of Continuity as the combination of a sliding tile puzzle and a platforming game. The idea felt clever, but I wasn't sure if people would actually enjoy playing it. And I wasn't sure how to make the game stay fun after the novel concept wore off. I explored using prototyping and playtesting.
        </p>

          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <h3>Is This Fun?</h3>
            <p>I began the design of Continuity by creating 3 levels as a paper prototype.</p>
            <p>I used it to get the team on board. I then playtested the prototype with players outside the team.</p>
            <p>Playtesters were intrigued by the game as a novel combination of familiar mechanics.</p>

          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <h3>Does the Fun Hold Up?</h3>
            <p>I iteratively playtested low-fidelity computer prototypes to start fleshing out the game.</p>
            <p>After several iterations, I was quite confident players enjoyed the game over a longer play session. However, I still wasn't sure what made the game fun.</p>

          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <h3>Discovering the Fun of Discovery</h3>
            <p>Eventually, I identified that players were especially excited by puzzles that required them to discover new aspects of the game's mechanics. These levels surprised players by expanding their concept of the game.</p>
            <p>In Continuity, the character is always paused in space when the game is zoomed out. This has been true for the first 12 levels, but you need to realize it to complete level 13.</p>

        <h2>Enhancing the Sense of Discovery</h2>
        <p class='section-description'>Our team had no real artist and coding wasn't our strong suit. Rather than adding new elements to the game for players to discover, I pursued designing levels that allowed players to make discoveries about the game's existing mechanics.</p>

            <h3>Focusing on Focused Levels</h3>
            <p>Through playtesting, I found players really enjoyed small levels focused around a specific insight. Unlike larger levels, these levels provided players a discrete moment of accomplishment when they found the solution.</p>
            <p>In this level, you learn that the character can be split between two tiles at once. You'll quickly complete the level once you make this realization.</p>

          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <h3>Frequently Introducing New Concepts</h3>
            <p>Playtests showed me that I needed to introduce new concepts evenly throughout Continuity so that players felt like they were always learning something new.</p>
            <p>In this level, you learn that the character can jump between adjacent tiles.</p>
          </div>

          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <h3>Modifying Concepts</h3>
            <p>Players appreciated small variations to previously learned concepts. Players generally solved these levels quickly, but felt smart for adapting existing knowledge.</p>
            <p>In this level, you again use the fact that the game world is paused when zoomed out. This time though, you need to jump up to a different tile first.</p>

          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <h3>Combining Concepts</h3>
            <p>Playtesters especially enjoyed levels where they needed to use a couple pieces of knowledge together.</p>
            <p>In this level, you must pause the character in mid-air while jumping between tiles.</p>

      <section id='teaching'>
        <h2>Teaching Through Discovery</h2>

        <p class='section-description'>Confident that the game was fun, I needed to onboard new players to the game. As a browser game, I expected players to have limited patience for any explicit tutorial. I set a goal to make learning the game part of your discovery.</p>

        <section>
          <img src='images/continuity/level-1.png' alt='' class='column columns_6'>
          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <h3>Letting You Experiment</h3>
            <p>Playtesting showed that players generally skipped any text. They just wanted to start messing with the game.</p>
            <p>So in the first level, you're shown the inputs. You play with them to figure out what they do.</p>
          </div>

          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <h3>Getting You Invested</h3>
            <p>Browser games are played on portals next to thousands of other games. I needed to quickly show you something interesting to keep you around.</p>
            <p>The second level shows you the game's concept. Playtests showed this as the game's "Oh!" moment, where players understand the concept and get excited by the novelty.</p>
          </div>

          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <h3>Designing Your Failure</h3>
            <p>In playtesting, I found that players learned more quickly from negative examples than positive ones. I designed levels so that players would try something, fail, and then consider what happened.</p>
            <p>The character can only move across edges that visually match. This level's design encourages you to move immediately to the right to get the key, but that won't work. Through failure, the you learn about matching edges.

          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <h3>Clarifying Through More Failure</h3>
            <p>I used playtesting to identify misconceptions about the game. I constructed new levels to show counterexamples.</p>
            <p>Players would only focus on matching the character's current "tunnel". This level shows you that the entire edge of the tile must match in order to  move across it.</p>

      <section id='data-and-feedback'>
        <h2>Using Data and Feedback</h2>
        <p class='section-description'>After Continuity shipped, we started to get feedback and data from players. I produced an update to the game that increased the average play sessions by over 20%.</p>

        <section>
          <img src='images/continuity/different-colors.png' alt='' class='column columns_6'>
          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <h3>Learning from What People Say</h3>
            <p>Originally, each tile in a Continuity puzzle was an arbitrary color to help you track each tile as they moved. I learned from forums that many players wrongly believed these colors affected when they could move between tiles.</p>
            <p>I removed the differing tile colors to avoid the confusion.  </p>
          </div>

          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <h3>Learning from What People Do</h3>
            <p>Google Analytics showed a sharp player drop-off around level 6. This was when the game got harder and levels got bigger.</p>
            <p>I added new levels to the game to gradually transition players to the later, harder levels.</p>
