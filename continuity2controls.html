            <p>
              <cite>Continuity</cite> is a puzzle game for PC.
              After its success, we wanted to bring a sequel to iOS.
              One of the major challenges of developing <cite>Continuity 2: The Continuation</cite> was designing the game's controls for touch screens so that they:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Never posed a challenge for the player</li>
              <li>Were comfortable for different play styles</li>
              <li>Were quickly learnable</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
            <cite>Continuity 2</cite> was designed and built by Stefan Mikaelsson and me.
            It was released in July, 2011.
            It has an 83 rating on Metacritic and a 4-star review on the App Store.

            <h3>Never Challenging</h3>
            <p>
            The challenge and fun of <cite>the original Continuity</cite> is in figuring out how to solve each puzzle.
            The controls should <strong>stay out of your way</strong> and not add to the challenge.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class='column columns_4'>
            <h3>Comfortable to Hold</h3>
            <p>
              Through playtesting, I found different ways that people are most comfortable holding their phones.
              I hoped that by designing for <strong>different preferences</strong>, the game would appeal to a wider audience.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class='column columns_4'>
            <h3>Quickly Learnable</h3>
            <p>
            As an inexpensive mobile game, you have little investment in sticking with the game. You should be able to quickly master the game's controls so that you can <strong>get on to solving puzzles and having fun</strong>.

            <p>
              <cite>Continuity</cite> is a puzzle game played on your PC in a browser.
            </p>
            <p>
              In each level, the player must move the character to collect the key and reach the door.
            </p>
            <p>
              You use two modes to do this:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Zoomed in</strong>: move character</li>
              <li><strong>Zoomed out</strong>: rearrange tiles</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              You play the game using a keyboard.

        <h2>Reducing the Challenge</h2>
        <p class='section-description'>
        I began the by identifying the challenges posed by <cite>the original Continuity</cite> in order to minimize them for <cite>Continuity 2</cite>.
        </p>
        <section>
          <img src='images/c2-survey.png' alt='An online survey asking players what they found problematic with Continuitys controls' class='column columns_6'>
          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <h3>Identifying Challenge in the Original</h3>
            <p>
            I conducted an <strong>online survey</strong> of <cite>the original Continuity's</cite> players to find out what was problematic with the controls.
            </p>
            <p>
            It indicated that players <strong>felt lost when zoomed in</strong>. This made sense; when zoomed in, you can only see part of the constantly rearranging level.
            </p>
          </div>
        </section>
        <section>
          <img src='images/c2-one-mode.png' alt='An image of a prototype in which the player can always see the whole level.' class='column columns_6'>
          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <h3>Keeping You From Feeling Lost</h3>
            <p>
            I <strong>created prototypes to help players always know where they are</strong> in a level. These prototypes used only one zoomed-out mode so that players could always see the whole level.
            </p>
            <p>
              Playtests showed that this added more challenges
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Players <strong>struggled to move tiles</strong> with onscreen buttons   overlapping them</li>
              <li>Players <strong>mistimed jumps</strong> due to the character being too   small on screen</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
        </section>
          <img src='images/c2-two-mode.png' alt='An image of a prototype in which the player plays in two modes: one zoomed in and one zoomed out.' class='column columns_6'>

            <h3>Am I Actually Meeting My Goals?</h3>
            <p>
            Trying to solve for the player feeling lost <strong>left players more frustrated</strong>. To compare, I made a prototype that worked in two-modes, like <cite>the original Continuity</cite>.
            </p>
            <p>
            Players greatly preferred the new prototype. They'd still get lost, but <strong>found it simple to zoom out, get their bearings, and zoom back it</strong>.

        <h2>Increasing Comfort for Everyone</h2>
        <p class='section-description'>
        In 2010, many people were not comfortable using their thumbs to control their phones. I changed <cite>Continuity 2's</cite> UI so that you could play with your thumbs or your index finger.
        </p>

        <section>
          <img src='images/c2-grips.png' alt='An image showing how some people use their thumbs to interact with their phone and others use an index finger.' class='column columns_6'>
          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <h3>Identifying Different Grips</h3>
            <p>
            Players were meant to hold their phones like a gamepad and press buttons with their thumbs. Playtesting showed <strong>certain players would try to use their index fingers instead</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Small buttons along the bottom of the screen didn't work well for index-grip players.
            </p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section>
          <img src='images/c2-touch-areas.png' alt='An image showing the new Controls of Continuity 2. The screen is divided into two touch areas. Touching either side moves the character in that direction.' class='column columns_6'>
          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <h3>Accomodating Index-grip Players</h3>
            <p>
            I modified the design to work well for both grip preferences. Instead of buttons, you <strong>pressed on either side of the screen to make the character run</strong> in that direction.
            </p>
            <p>
            Playtesting showed that some <strong> index-grip players would swipe on the character to make it run</strong>. Since they touched to one side of the character, it would run a few steps, then stop. This positive feedback let players satisfice with their slow, physically exhausting approach.
            </p>

          <div class='column columns_6'>
            <h3>Refining for Index Grips</h3>
            <p>
            I wanted to provide <strong>negative feedback to swiping the character</strong>. I introduced a "dead zone" in the center of the screen where touches (and swipes) were ignored.
            </p>
            <p>
            After this change, players that tried swiping would see no result, and then go on to <strong>discover the desired way to play</strong>.

        <h2>Teaching Quickly</h2>

        <p class='section-description'>
        I needed to teach players how to use the game's controls quickly so they'd stay engaged. I wanted to teach people as they play, so they don't feel like they have to sit and learn.
        </p>

            <h3>Trying the Same Thing as the Original</h3>
            <p>
            <cite>The original Continuity</cite> used <strong>static graphics to teach its controls</strong>. I used this same approach as a starting point for <cite>Continuity 2</cite>.
            </p>
            <p>
            Playtests showed that <cite>Continuity 2's</cite> controls were <strong>too contextual for static images</strong>. Players didn't know which graphics to follow at any moment.

            <h3>Teaching Contextually</h3>
            <p>
            Through playtesting, <strong>I refined an interactive system</strong> to teach the controls for <cite>Continuity 2</cite>. Players learn concepts over the course of three small levels.
            </p>
            <p>
            Each level <strong>first tells</strong> you what you'll learn and <strong>then shows</strong> you what to do with contextual animations.
